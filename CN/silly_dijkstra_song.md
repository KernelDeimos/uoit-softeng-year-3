## This is a song that my brain made up during a Computer Networks lecture.

```
I wanna be the shortest path,
like no node ever was;

To relax edges is my real task,
to find the MST is my cause;

with Dijkstra!

I will travel accross the graph,
searching far and wide;

To teach each node to understand,
the shortest path behind;

with Dijkstra!

Oh, it's U and V;
the distance between them's 3!

With Dijkstra!

Through point W,
'cause U-V was 22!
```
